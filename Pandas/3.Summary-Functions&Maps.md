## Median & Mean
For ex: Median of the `points` column in the `reviews` DataFrame
```
reviews.points.median()
```
Create variable `centered_price` containing a version of the `price` column with the mean price subtracted.

**Note: this 'centering' transformation is a common preprocessing step before applying various machine learning algorithms.**

```
centered_price = reviews.price - reviews.price.mean()
```
### Maximum/ Minimum value => idxmax(), idxmin()
Create a variable `bargain_wine` with the title of the wine with the highest points-to-price ratio in the dataset
```
bargain_idx = (reviews.points / reviews.price).idxmax()
bargain_wine = reviews.loc[bargain_idx, 'title']
```


## Unique:
What countries are represented in the dataset? (Your answer should not include any duplicates.)
```
countries = reviews.country.unique()
print(type(countries))

Out: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

## Count the frequency of Data:

How often does each country appear in the dataset?
```
reviews_per_country = reviews.country.value_counts()
print(type(reviews_per_country))

Out: <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
```
