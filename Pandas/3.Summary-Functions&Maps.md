## Median
For ex: Median of the `points` column in the `reviews` DataFrame
```
reviews.points.median()
```

## Unique:
What countries are represented in the dataset? (Your answer should not include any duplicates.)
```
countries = reviews.country.unique()
print(type(countries))

Out: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```
