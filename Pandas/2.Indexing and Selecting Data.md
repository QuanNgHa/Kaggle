## Selecting Column
Select the `description` column from `reviews` and assign the result to the variable `desc`.
```
desc = reviews.description
```
or
```
desc = reviews["description"]
```
`desc` is a pandas `Series` object, with an index matching the reviews DataFrame.<br>
**In general,select a single column from a DataFrame, we'll get a Series**

## Select Row
Select the first row of data (the first record) from `reviews`
```
reviews.iloc[0]
```
## Select Value
### Select the first `value` from the description column of reviews
```
reviews.description.iloc[0]
```
This is the preferred way to obtain the entry in the `DataFrame`, 
many other options will return a valid result, such as 
```
reviews.description.loc[0]
reviews.description[0]
reviews['description'][0]
```
### Select the first `10 values` from the description column in reviews
```
reviews.description.iloc[:10]
```
**Note: 0:10, but not include 10th value => Total values selected = 10**

### Select values from `different` rows (index)

Select the records with index labels `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, and `8`
```
indices = [1,2,3,5,8]
reviews.iloc[indices]
reviews.loc[indices]
```
