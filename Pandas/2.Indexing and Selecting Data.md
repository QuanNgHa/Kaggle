## Selecting Column
Select the `description` column from `reviews` and assign the result to the variable `desc`.
```
desc = reviews.description
```
or
```
desc = reviews["description"]
```
`desc` is a pandas `Series` object, with an index matching the reviews DataFrame.<br>
**In general,select a single column from a DataFrame, we'll get a Series**

## Select Row
Select the first row of data (the first record) from `reviews`
```
reviews.iloc[0]
```
## Select Value
### .iloc[] vs .loc[]
> `iloc` u first element of the range is included BUT the last one excluded.<br> 
    &rightarrow; So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. <br> 
> `loc`: indexes inclusively. <br>
    &rightarrow; So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.
<br><br> For example: Create a variable `df` containing the `country` and `variety` columns of the first 100 records. 

* **iloc[row indices, [colummns' *indices* selected] ]**

  ```
    cols_idx = [0, 11]
    df = reviews.iloc[:100, cols_idx]
  ```
* **loc[row indices, [colummns' *names* selected] ]**
  ```
    df = reviews.loc[:99, ["country", "variety"]]
  ```

#### Select the first `value` from the description column of reviews
```
reviews.description.iloc[0]
```
This is the preferred way to obtain the entry in the `DataFrame`, 
many other options will return a valid result, such as 
```
reviews.description.loc[0]
reviews.description[0]
reviews['description'][0]
```
#### Select the first `10 values` from the description column in reviews
```
reviews.description.iloc[:10]
```


#### Select values from `different rows` (index)

Select the records with index labels `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, and `8`
```
indices = [1,2,3,5,8]
reviews.iloc[indices]
reviews.loc[indices]
```
#### Select values from `different rows & different columns` (index)

```
cols = ['country', 'province', 'region_1', 'region_2']
indices = [0, 1, 10, 100]
df = reviews.loc[indices, cols]
```

## Filter

#### Create a DataFrame `italian_wines` containing reviews of wines made in `Italy`

```
reviews[reviews.country == 'Italy']
```

#### Create a DataFrame `top_oceania_wines` containing all reviews with at least 95 points (out of 100) for wines from Australia or New Zealand.

```
reviews.loc[(reviews.country.isin(['Australia', 'New Zealand']))
            & (reviews.points >= 95)]
```
