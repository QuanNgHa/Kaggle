## Selecting Column
Select the `description` column from `reviews` and assign the result to the variable `desc`.
```
desc = reviews.description
```
or
```
desc = reviews["description"]
```
`desc` is a pandas `Series` object, with an index matching the reviews DataFrame. 
**In general,select a single column from a DataFrame, we'll get a Series**
