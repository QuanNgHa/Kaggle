## Selecting Column
Select the `description` column from `reviews` and assign the result to the variable `desc`.
```
desc = reviews.description
```
or
```
desc = reviews["description"]
```
`desc` is a pandas `Series` object, with an index matching the reviews DataFrame.<br>
**In general,select a single column from a DataFrame, we'll get a Series**

## Select Row


## Select Value
Select the first value from the description column of `reviews`
```
reviews.description.iloc[0]
```
This is the preferred way to obtain the entry in the `DataFrame`, 
many other options will return a valid result, such as 
```
reviews.description.loc[0]
reviews.description[0]
reviews['description'][0]
```
